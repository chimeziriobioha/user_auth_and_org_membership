Stage Two Task for backend programming participants in HNG11 Internship

--User Authentication & Organisation Membership--



THE TASK INVOLVES:
- Connecting to a Postgres database server
- Creating User model and authencication system (Email/Password & JWT)
- Creating Organisation model and allowing authenticated users to create org, add members, and view records
- Writing unittest to assert every thing functions well



FUN FACT 😁:

I spent 3 debug hours to find and replace **SECREST_KEY** with **SECRET_KEY** at some point in this task so that production API can function. Becasue, why not? If you put "S" where it shouldn't be, you'll explain till you tire. No evidence!!! Thanks to [Sentry-Python](https://ginhub.com/getsentry/sentry-python) which I utilised into the 2nd hour (should have used it earlier) to figure it out.
